## script section


we make an component called App.

react functional components must return a markup - `returned by React.CreateElement`

## props

these are variables that are passed from a parent component to a child component 

you pass props as an argument.

so to access the props in the child component you: `props.AttributeName`

to pass this props in the parent component where you call the component you: `<ChildComponent props.AttributeName = "attribute value" />`
## npm 

npm allows you to bring in code from the npm registry which is a bunch of open source modules that people have written so you can use them in your project.

to start an npm project in your react project you run `npm init`
